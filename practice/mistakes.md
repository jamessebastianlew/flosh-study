# general data structures

forgetting to run the initialisation function

forgetting to put query(l-1, r) because the range
has part non inclusive and are 0 indexed

# recursive segment trees

forgetting to use val instead of dd[id]

doing l, mid instead of mid, r

doing lo+hi instead of l+r

forgetting that the children know nothing about
what the parents know

forgetting the update needs to update nodes that
arent directly responsible for the exact [lo, hi)
range

# topsort dfs

forgetting the topsort comes out in reversed order

# kosarajus

forgetting to use the tranposed graph rather than the original

# iterative segment trees

doing L-- instead of L++
